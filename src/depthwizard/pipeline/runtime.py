    """Production runtime with confidence-aware, physically truthful metric calibration.

    Model-native confidence is never presented as a calibrated probability. When it has usable
    spatial variation, DepthWizard converts it monotonically to a conservative uncertainty weight
    that can only down-weight DEM anchors. Missing or degenerate confidence falls back to the
    established DEM-only weighting path rather than fabricating reliability.

    Every metric path requires a trustworthy physical/geospatial source grid. DEM calibration is
    stricter still: the DEM must also expose trustworthy physical ground spacing. Without that pair,
    DepthWizard cannot know the DEM's effective support relative to the optical grid, so it fails
    closed instead of treating upsampled DEM pixels as independent metric evidence. GCP-only
    calibration may establish the vertical datum/scale, but it is not allowed to launder an
    implausible or physically uninterpretable source CRS into an "absolute geospatial DSM" claim.
